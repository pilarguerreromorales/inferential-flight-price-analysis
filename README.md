# Flight Price Analysis in India

This repository contains the final project for **Fundamentals of Data Analysis**, focusing on identifying the main drivers of domestic flight prices in India. Using **inferential statistics** and **linear regression modeling**, the study explores how factors such as airline, source, destination, number of stops, duration, and travel time (day vs. night) influence ticket costs.

##  Project Overview

- **Objective**: Help travelers and agencies understand the key factors that influence airfare in India, supporting both **low-cost** and **premium travel** decisions.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Data exploration (outliers, missing values, categorical vs. numerical variables).  
  - Hypothesis testing on airline, stops, duration, and time of travel.  
  - Linear regression modeling with reduced model selection and validation.

## Key Insights

- **Business and premium classes** have significantly higher average prices.  
- **Non-stop flights** are generally cheaper due to shorter distances.  
- **Night flights** are statistically cheaper than day flights.  
- **Month and day** of travel influence ticket costs (prices tend to decrease later in the month and during June).  
- Regression model explains ~60% of price variability, providing useful but not fully exhaustive predictions.
